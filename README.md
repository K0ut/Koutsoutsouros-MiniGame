Mine Destroyer

You are a boat that is destroying mines that are in your territory of the sea and must keep  destroying them until there all gone.
How to play- move around with the arrow keys, shoot bullets with the space bar.
Dev Log- I made it so if the player destroys all six mines, six more mines will spawn in random locations on the map.
I used the moivement from the first unity project with the car to make the boat move, and used some facters of the spawn from the animal mini-0game and guidence from my professor for how to set it up.
